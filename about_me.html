                            <p>I recently received my Industrial Engineer degree from ICAI School of Engineering.
                                    I choose to study this degree since I like solving problems. However, I took a machine learning course in my third year of college, where I first learned about the fascinating field of data science.
                            </p>

                            <div class="image fit"><img src="images/foto_moto.JPG"width="900" /></div>
                            
                            &nbsp


                            <p>I've been fascinated by this field since that. That's the reason why I have been learning about this world and therefore, I am looking forward to heading my professional career in this direction. My ultimate goal is to combine my two passions, but first, I want to become a master in the field of data science.</p>
                            <p>I dug deep into a crucial machine learning topic for my final degree thesis. The silent failure of machine learning models. Several factors may be to blame for this. Data drift is most crucial and therefore I created a framework to detect data drift on the early stages, preventing algorithms from losing performance. </p>

                            <p>I enrolled in a Nanodegree in Machine Learning right after receiving my degree and I am willing to put my knowledge into some real-world problems.</p>
                            <p>My long-term goal is to become an expert in data science, for that I have set myself a second short-term goal which is to learn as much as I can on my own and inside of a company about real world data science applications.</p>
                            <h3>Apart from that, and to let you know more about me:</h3>
                            <p>I'm a very energetic and proactive person. I enjoy the challenge and learning new things. I love sports, I am open to practice almost all of them, but my go-to sports are calisthenics and padel. </p>
                            
                            <p>I also have a hobby. I began purchasing enduro motorcycles to restore three years ago, and it has gradually turned into a hobby. In fact, my actual motorcycle didn't work when I bought it. The images below are just an example of the process of one! I enjoy doing the things I love, but I don't often stay in my comfort zone because I enjoy change, the challenge, and new experiences. </p>

                            <p>When I was accepted as an exchange student in Trondheim, Norway last year, I particularly reaffirm that I enjoy change, the challenge, and new experiences. I chose that destination because I wanted to learn how to adapt to new environments. After a year there, I would rate the experience a 10/10.</p>
